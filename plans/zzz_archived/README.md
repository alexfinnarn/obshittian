# Archived Plans

Place archived plans in this directory. If the plans are not self-contained in a directory, then 
please create a new directory and place all the related plans in that directory. 

For example, here is a potential plan before archiving. 

```
- plans
-- README.md # Main plans readme
-- _archived/
--- README.md  # Main archive readme 
-- MAIN_PLAN.md # Overview plan
-- main_plan-phase-01-start.md # phase of plan
-- main_plan-phase-02-middle.md
-- main_plan-phase-03-end.md
```

And after archiving all the old plans have been moved to the `main-plan` directory in the 
archive folder. 

``` 
- plans
-- README.md # Main plans readme
-- _archived/
--- README.md  # Main archive readme 
--- main-plan/
---- phase-01-start.md # phase of plan
---- phase-02-middle.md
---- phase-03-end.md
```
